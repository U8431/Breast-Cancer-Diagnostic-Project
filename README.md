# Breast-Cancer-Diagnostic-Project
Breast cancer diagnostic system using Python and ML algorithms for tumor classification (Benign vs Malignant).
<br>
This project focuses on building a Breast Cancer Diagnostic System using machine learning techniques to classify breast tumors as Benign (B) or Malignant (M). The model is trained using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset, which contains various features extracted from breast tissue images such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and symmetry.

The dataset used in this project comes from real medical tests called Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA). From these tests, doctors measure different properties of breast cells such as size, shape, texture, smoothness, and symmetry. These measurements are stored as numerical data, but by themselves, they don’t clearly tell whether cancer is present. This is where data science helps.
